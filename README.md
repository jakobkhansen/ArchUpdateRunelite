# ArchUpdateRunelite
Stop using outdated AUR repositories to update RuneLite. 
This simple script updates the appimage of runelite and places it under ~/.runelite/RuneLite.AppImage.
Now all you have to do is add a desktop file/alias to this file and you have automatic RuneLite updating.
Tested only in Arch/Manjaro.
